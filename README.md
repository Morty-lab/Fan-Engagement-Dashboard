# Fan Engagement App

This is the fan engagement app created with Laravel and React using an API-based approach meaning that these apps are not connected code-wise.

## Installation

For the API installation go to the [chatter-api](https://github.com/Morty-lab/Fan-Engagement-Dashboard/tree/main/chatter-api) folder for the installation guide and API documentation, for the app installation go to the [fan-engagement-dashboard](https://github.com/Morty-lab/Fan-Engagement-Dashboard/tree/main/fan-engagement-dashboard) folder.

## Technologies and Rationale

This app was made with React Typescript due to its versatility together with Tailwind CSS and the API was made with Laravel due to its capability of an API-only approach.
